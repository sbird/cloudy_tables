Scripts for computing ionisation fractions from Cloudy ionisation tables.

make_cloudy_input.py runs cloudy a number of times and creates the files
in a directory structure. For this to work, you must have data for a UVB in UVB_Tables/
and cloudy installed.

convert_cloudy contains routines that generate ionisation fractions as a 
function of temperature and density.
The first time these routines are run they read and parse the ionisation tables generated
by make_cloudy_input and save the results in cloudy_table.npz for ease of access.
