# "A New Calculation of the Ionizing Background Spectrum 
# and the Effects of HeII Reionization" (arXiv:0901.4554)

#
#
# December 2011 update:
#
# - Corrected normalization inconsistency between individual spectra and 
#  TREECOOL file (by a factor of 0.9).
# - TREECOOL and spectrum files now smoothly truncated at z~10 in order to 
#   produce a redshift of reionization consistent with the WMAP-7 electron
#   scattering optical depth.
#
# Data updated June 2011:
# 
# - Same ionization source prescription as in '09 paper and in good 
#   agreement at overlapping redshifts. 
# - Now extends to z=15 and nu=4,096 Ry, with better convergence properties 
#   at high z.
# - More realistic (larger) LyC break, assuming 10% escape fraction of 
#   ionizing photons from star-forming galaxies and a factor of 4 break
#   intrinsic to the stars. Results in higher spectrum at wavelengths
#   longward of 912 A.
#
# Note: Because the mean free path of HeII ionizing photons becomes
#       extremely short just above 4 Ry at z>~4, as quasars become rare,
#       the spectra are not well converged in this regime. 
#
#       This may affect ionization corrections that depend on the value of
#       the spectrum there. This is however in the regime where HeII 
#       reionization is not complete in this model, and where the spectrum 
#       in the HeII ionizing range should not be trusted in any case.
#
#       The absolute values of the HeII photoionization and photoheating rates
#       are very small in this regime, and so this should not have a significant
#       impact on hydro simulations run with the TREECOOL file provided.

# log(1+z), Gamma_HI, Gamma_HeI, Gamma_HeII,  Qdot_HI, Qdot_HeI, Qdot_HeII, 
# where 'Gamma' is the photoionization rate and 'Qdot' is the photoheating rate. 
# The Gamma's are in units of s^-1, and the Qdot's are in units of erg s^-1.
